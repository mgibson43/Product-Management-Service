        <h2>Our Founding</h2>
        <p>
            Piano Parlor began with the simple yet powerful realization that struck Mr. Gamgee.
            "I like pianos," thought Mr. Gamgee. From that moment, Mr. Gamgee knew what he had to do,
            he had to create a piano store with selling power so potent that it could rival the one ring.
            And thus, Piano Parlor was born.
